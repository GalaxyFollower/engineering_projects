<h1>Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition Engine Analysis </h1>



<strong>Project description:</strong>

Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine is a new type of engine that can reduce pollutant emission while achieving high fuel efficiency. HCCI engines can operate with various types of fuels such as gasoline, diesel, alcohols, natural gas and most alternative fuels.



HCCI engines typically operate with premixed fuel-air mixtures in fuel-lean condition. Ignition is caused by compression, and typically the high compression ratio is high, say larger than 15. The efficiency of HCCI engines is therefore quite good.
