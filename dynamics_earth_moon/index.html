<h1>Dynamics - Simulation of Motion of Earth and Moon Around the Sun</h1>

<br><br>

Project A: Simulation of Motion of Earth and Moon Around the Sun.
Created Matlab script that used leapfrog integration method for numerically integrating differential equations. Calculated force between bodies using Newton&#39;s law of universal gravitation.

<br><br>

Project B: Motion of a Binary Star System.
Binary star system of two stars with radius R and 5R and of the same density. The center of mass of the system is fixed while their maximum distance is approximately100R.

<br><br>

Project C: Motion of a Trinary Star System.
Same system as Project B, but a third star of radius R 4 rotates about the star of radius R at a distance 10R . All stars have the same density
