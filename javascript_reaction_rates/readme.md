<h1>Simple Javascript Reaction Rates App </h1>



<strong>Summary:</strong>

The Arrhenius equation is an equation with 3 parameters (A,B,E) that is used to calculate reaction rates.  Here I used the jscharts free charts generator to make a graph of log base 10 of the reaction rate over a range of temperatures.  A separate function kf.js is called to calculate the actual reaction rate.  The function log10() is used to calculate the log base 10 of the reaction rate.  Note: log10(x)=ln(x)/ln(10)
