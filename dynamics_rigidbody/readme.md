<h1>Dynamics - Stability of Rigidbody </h1>



Euler Equations of rotation are used to model the stability of the free motion of a rigid body which is rotating about one of its principal axes. The set of the principal axes is attached to the center of mass and these axes are fixed in the body.



The analytical period is calculated and compared to numerically derived.
