I am also working on a new project that involves using a 3D printer to print a waterproof Raspberry Pi case that holds the Pi unit, camera, as well as a battery and wires to connect to a button that activates a time-lapse photo command.  I use crontab to run a python script at start up, which waits for a voltage change indicated by a button being pressed.  The trick is that the time-lapse photo command is sent when the button is released, because I have built in that if you hold the button down for 5 seconds then the computer turns itself off.  The pseudo-code for the algorithm is as follows:The code scans the GPIO port every 1/10 of a second to see if button is being pressed.  If pressed the variable take_photo is set to 1, and 1 is added to button_counter.  If button_counter exceeds 50, the linux command “sudo shutdown –h now” is sent to the system, and the program will soon be terminated.  If button_counter does not exceed 50, when the code scans the GPIO and sees that the button is not pressed button_counter is set to zero, if take_photo equals one, then we set it to zero, and send command to system to run time lapse command. I am in the process of fully analyzing this button circuit in order to present it as an educational tool for my next maker faire presentation.
